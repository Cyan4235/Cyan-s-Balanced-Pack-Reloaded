# Cyan-s-Balanced-Pack-Reloaded
Pack intended to expand on the game while also balancing various factors to ensure a decent difficulty curve is maintained.  This pack may be slightly more difficult than the Vanilla experience, but also tries not to deviate too far from Vanilla.

        Balanced modpack that intends to balance and add quality of life to the vanilla experience while also engaging player experience with more options.  This pack is not intended to make the game easier, and may in some ways add increased difficulty, but does not intend to give the player the ability to cheat, or allow the player to exploit gameplay.  I'll try to keep this pack updated regularly, and may even rehaul it as necessary with the changing cuurrent of aavailable and updated mods.

        Suggestions & Feedback are appreciated and welcomed, but please refrain from submitting suggestions that are clearly outside of the intention of the pack.  Things such as infinite stats, items, stamina, health, god mode, and other cheat-like suggestions/options will be removed without being considered.  Also please note that I am not a mod developer, there may be bugs/glitches/issues that I may not be able to fix.  I'm moree likely to disable and consider removing a mod if it causes notable issues.  As such, the modpack may change dramatically at times to deal with issues outside of my control.  I will however forward issues to the mod developers, assuming they have a method of communication available to do so.  Additionally do not harass or complain to a mod developer because of an issue you found while using this pack, it is entirely possible the issue may be a result of poor mod compatibility, or overlapping features causing issues and compatibility problems as they tend to happen with sizable modpacks.

<hr><h2>                !!! UPDATING THE PACK !!!</h2>
        If you are using this modpack with the Gale or R2ModMan Mod Managers, and you are using only the mods included in the pack.  You will need to do some cleanup before updating, as the mod managers do not currently remove mods automatically when updating a modpack.  Be sure to backup your profile before updating in case something goes wrong.  Additionally if you have modified any of the config files, you will need to backup those, then replace the configs after updating.
<h3><span>        !!! I highly recommend checking for updates to mod configs prior to replacing the pack configs.  As the mod developer may have altered or changed the config files entirely with any updates.  Failure to do so could cause errors, crashes, bugs, glitches, or other strange issues, and I will not assist in troubleshooting issues that may be related. !!!</span></h3>
<p><span>To properly update this modpack:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>For the easy method, delete the profile you have the modpack on, then create a new profile, and finally redownload the modpack.</li>
<li>If you have mods you want to keep, then you will need to uninstall all mods associated with the modpack, including the modpack itself.  Then redownload the modpack.</li>
<li>If you are not using a Mod Manager, then you will need to handle everything manually.  This includes the config files.</li>
</ul>
